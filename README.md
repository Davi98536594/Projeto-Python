# Quickstart

To use the Python interpreter in your main file, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your main Python file is located.
3. Run the following command to start the Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    Replace `main.py` with the name of your main Python file if it's different.

4. The Python interpreter will execute your code and display the output, if any.
